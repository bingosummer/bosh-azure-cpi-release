Features:

- Support Azure managed identity. See the [doc](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-azure-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/advanced/managed-identity) for details. (#591)

  1. Managed identity can be configured on VMs via `vm_extensions`;

  2. Managed identity can be used as credential source of CPI;

  3. Both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity are supported.

- Refine the scenario of `vm_resources`. (#552)

  The CPI method `calculate_vm_cloud_properties` returns a list of instance types.

    1. The instance types are available in the location, which is specified in CPI global configuration.

    2. The instance types meet the requested 'vm_resources'.

    3. The instance types which support Premium storage are recommended.

  When creating VMs, CPI will:

    1. Check whether the disks are persistent disks. If so, use the instance types which support premium storage.

    2. Use the instance types which are available in the available sets.

- Upgrade Compute API version to `2018-04-01`. (#495)

- Support a new cloud property `type` for the root & ephemeral disk. (#498)

- Support managed disk type `StandardSSD_LRS`. (#498)

- Support configuring the resource group for load balancer and security group. (#541)

- Support application security groups in Azure USGov Cloud and Azure German Cloud. (#463)


Fixes:

- Make independent tasks async when creating or deleting VMs. (#465)

- Use SAS token url to copy stemcell. CPI doesn't require the stemcell container to be public. (#511)

- Increase the data disk max count, because Azure documents update the [`Max data disks` of each VM size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes). (#502)

- Delete the deprecated user image only once. (#567)

- Remove the disk path in the registry settings, since it's not used any longer. (#501)

V25

New Features:

  * For AzureStack, CPI uses the same SCSI host device ID as Azure so that it works correctly with the stemcell `v3232.5+`. #276

  * VM is created in the same location with the virtual network instead of the storage account. #274

Fixes:

  * Handle the connection reset error to azure blob storage. #268

  * Retry once and only once if CPI receives AzureConflictError when deleting a managed disk. #269

  * Specify the disk size when attaching an unmanaged disk. Otherwise, the disk size can't be shown by Azure Portal or Azure CLI. #275

  * For AzureStack, CPI uses the same resource provider API versions as Azure. #285

Improvements:

  * Bump bosh_cpi version from 1.3262.4.0 to 2.1.1. #273

  * Upgrade azure-storage-ruby to `v0.12.1-preview`. #268
